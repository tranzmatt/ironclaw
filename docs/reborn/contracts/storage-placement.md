# Reborn Contract — Storage Placement

**Status:** Contract-freeze draft
**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Depends on:** [`host-api.md`](host-api.md), [`filesystem.md`](filesystem.md), [`memory.md`](memory.md), [`secrets.md`](secrets.md), [`events-projections.md`](events-projections.md)

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract freezes where durable state lives in Reborn.

The rule is hybrid:

```text
File-shaped content and virtual path authority
  -> RootFilesystem / ScopedFilesystem / CompositeRootFilesystem

Structured, query-heavy, control-plane, or security-sensitive records
  -> typed repositories owned by the service domain

Derived data such as chunks, search indexes, embeddings, and projections
  -> the owning service/indexer/projection layer
```

This prevents two failure modes:

1. forcing every durable record into ad hoc JSON files;
2. hiding file-shaped content behind unrelated typed APIs;
3. creating a single omniscient data-store crate that owns unrelated domain semantics.

A shared storage substrate may own common mechanics such as backend identity,
redacted storage errors, migration descriptors, pagination helpers, JSON
encoding/decoding helpers, connection/transaction conventions, and encrypted
record/blob primitives. It must not own domain operations such as “claim turn”,
“accept inbound message”, “advance outbound cursor”, or “issue credential
session”. Those remain in the typed service/domain crates.

---

## 2. Scope model

Every durable placement must be scoped by the global Reborn scope model where applicable:

```text
tenant_id     required for hosted production state
user_id       required for user-owned state
project_id    optional, required for project-owned state
agent_id      optional first-class scope for per-agent memory/state isolation
mission_id    optional project execution scope
thread_id     optional conversation/turn scope
process_id    optional runtime/process scope
invocation_id optional effect/request scope
```

`AgentId` is first-class because current production workspace memory has optional `agent_id` partitioning. New storage contracts must either carry it or explicitly state why the domain is not agent-scoped.

---

## 3. Ownership versus mechanics

Storage design decisions must answer two separate questions:

```text
Ownership: which domain owns schema meaning, invariants, validation, and operations?
Mechanics: which shared layer owns repeated DB/runtime plumbing?
```

Domain crates own typed traits and semantics:

```text
ironclaw_turns::TurnStateStore
ironclaw_threads::SessionThreadService
ironclaw_outbound::OutboundStateStore
ironclaw_secrets::CredentialAccountStore / CredentialSessionStore / future SecretStore
```

The shared storage substrate may provide reusable mechanics:

```text
ironclaw_storage::StorageBackendKind
ironclaw_storage::StorageError
ironclaw_storage::StorageMigration
ironclaw_storage::encode_json / decode_json
ironclaw_storage::PageLimit
ironclaw_storage::BlobStore / RecordStore primitives
```

Primitive substrate families should stay small and mechanics-only:

```text
BlobStore          binary/object bytes, including future encrypted blobs
RecordStore        keyed structured records with CAS/version preconditions
AppendLog          ordered event/audit/projection streams with cursors
LockStore          leases, heartbeats, fencing tokens
TransactionalStore backend transaction boundary for multi-record operations
```

These primitives are not replacements for domain APIs. For example, callers
should still use `TurnStateStore::claim_next_run`,
`SessionThreadService::accept_inbound_message`,
`OutboundStateStore::advance_subscription_cursor`, and the secret-store APIs
instead of reaching into primitive stores directly.

Rules:

- domain adapters may depend on shared storage mechanics;
- shared storage must not depend on domain crates;
- filesystem may implement file-shaped or raw encrypted blob backends, but must not become the owner of structured control-plane semantics;
- a future adapter crate may collect concrete SQL implementations, but the owning domain contracts still define allowed operations and invariants.

Filesystem-like views over structured state are allowed when useful for
operators, import/export, diagnostics, or AI-readable inspection:

```text
/reborn/threads/{thread}/messages/{message}.json
/reborn/turns/{turn}/runs/{run}.json
/reborn/outbound/subscriptions/{subscription}.json
/reborn/events/{stream}/{cursor}.json
/secrets/... redacted metadata projection only
```

Default rule: these views are projections, not the source of truth. If a view
allows writes, the write must validate and call the typed domain API; it must
not bypass domain invariants by mutating primitive storage rows directly.

## 4. Canonical namespace/source-of-truth map

| Virtual area | Source of truth | Access surface | Indexed? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/memory` | `ironclaw_memory_native` provider — currently a `FilesystemMemoryDocumentRepository` over `RootFilesystem` (a dedicated `reborn_memory_*` SQL-table model is the deferred target), behind the `ironclaw_memory` contract | file-shaped memory docs + memory service APIs | backend-defined full-text/vector | Memory-specific path grammar is defined by the `ironclaw_memory` contract, not filesystem. |
| `/users` | typed user/profile repositories + optional user config projection | user/profile APIs + optional file projection | no, unless projection says otherwise | User-owned durable profile and configuration areas. |
| `/projects` | local/object/project file backend | filesystem | optional project indexer | Project source files and user-authored project artifacts. |
| `/system/settings` | typed settings repository | typed API + optional file projection | no, unless projection says otherwise | Settings source of truth is not memory. |
| `/system/extensions` | extension package/registry repositories | extension API + filesystem package reads/projections | no semantic memory indexing | Installed packages, manifests, registry state. |
| `/system/skills` | skill package/registry repositories | skill API + optional file projection | no semantic memory indexing | Skill manifests and installed skill state. |
| `/engine/runtime` | typed run/thread/process/turn repositories, or NotIndexed `/engine` DB filesystem for file-shaped runtime blobs | typed APIs primarily | no | High-churn runtime state must not pollute memory indexes. |
| `/artifacts` | artifact/object/local backend | artifact APIs + filesystem refs | no semantic memory indexing by default | Large/binary/process output refs live here. |
| `/tmp` | ephemeral runtime temp backend | scoped filesystem | no | Process/invocation-local temporary data. |
| `/secrets` | typed encrypted secret repository | secret APIs only; optional redacted projection | no | No generic listing of secret material/source records. |
| `/events` | durable event/audit append log + projections | event/projection APIs; optional export | no | Events are append/projection records, not mutable files. |
| `/engine/openai_compat/refs` | `ironclaw_reborn_openai_compat_storage` implementing `OpenAiCompatRefStore` over `RootFilesystem` | OpenAI-compatible ref/idempotency API only | no | Source of truth for opaque `chatcmpl-*` / `resp_*` public refs, actor-scoped idempotency, and internal ProductWorkflow/projection refs. Initial adapter stores a CAS-protected state record at `/engine/openai_compat/refs/state.json`; PostgreSQL/libSQL parity comes from the selected `RootFilesystem` backend. |
| `/processes` | typed process-lifecycle repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (records, results, outputs) | process APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_processes`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/authorization` | typed capability-lease repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` | lease APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_authorization`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/outbound` | typed outbound-delivery repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (policies, subscriptions, attempts) | outbound APIs | indexed scope projection | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_outbound`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/run-state` | typed invocation-lifecycle repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (run records) | run-state APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_run_state`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/approvals` | typed approval-request repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (approval records) | run-state APIs | no | Sibling consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_run_state`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/threads` | typed session-thread and transcript repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (thread records, message records, summary artifacts, inbound idempotency) | thread/transcript APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_threads`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/conversations` | typed conversation binding / session-thread state routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (singleton state record) | conversation services APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_conversations`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/turns` | typed turn-coordination persistence routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (single snapshot blob of turns, runs, checkpoints, idempotency, events, reservations) | turn coordinator APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_turns`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/checkpoint-state` | host-owned loop checkpoint payload repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (opaque resume payload records keyed by checkpoint state refs) | checkpoint state store APIs only | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_turns`; public turn/checkpoint/event records store only metadata and refs, never raw checkpoint payload bytes. |
| `/resources` | typed resource-governor snapshot repository routed through `ironclaw_filesystem` (reservation/usage snapshots) | resource governor APIs | no | Consumer mount alias for `ironclaw_resources`; alias-relative under the per-invocation `MountView`. |
| `/tenant-shared` | per-tenant shared mount; resolves to `/tenants/<tenant_id>/shared/...` under the per-invocation `MountView` | scoped filesystem | no | Data shared between users/agents in the same tenant. |
| `/tenants` | reserved root for tenant-scoped target subtrees written by the per-invocation `MountView` | scoped filesystem | no | Not a consumer-visible alias; only consumed at the mount-table layer by the rewritten `VirtualPath` targets (`/tenants/<tenant_id>/users/<user_id>/<alias>/...`). |

## 5. Placement rules by content type

### 5.1 File-shaped user/project content

Examples:

```text
/projects/{project}/src/lib.rs
/projects/{project}/README.md
/artifacts/{process}/result.json
```

Rules:

- source of truth may be local filesystem, object store, or DB-backed file store;
- access to runtimes goes through `ScopedFilesystem` and `MountView`;
- raw host paths never appear in runtime-visible paths, errors, events, or audit;
- indexing is explicit and owned by a project/artifact indexer, not by `RootFilesystem`.

### 5.2 Memory documents

Examples:

```text
/memory/tenants/{tenant}/users/{user}/agents/{agent-or-_none}/projects/{project-or-_none}/MEMORY.md
/memory/tenants/{tenant}/users/{user}/agents/{agent-or-_none}/projects/{project-or-_none}/daily/2026-04-25.md
```

Rules:

- source of truth is the memory repository, preserving existing production table family where viable;
- memory docs are file-shaped, but memory search/chunks/versions are structured derived state;
- memory path grammar, metadata inheritance, versioning, search, prompt context, and layer rules are defined by the provider-neutral `ironclaw_memory` contract and implemented in the `ironclaw_memory_native` provider (#3537 lift);
- `ironclaw_filesystem` may route/mount memory backends but must not encode memory semantics.

### 5.3 Structured control-plane state

Examples:

```text
settings
extension registry
skill registry
approvals
run-state
process records
resource reservations
secret records
event/audit records
```

Rules:

- source of truth is a typed repository owned by the domain;
- optional file-shaped projections may exist for diagnostics, import/export, or admin editing;
- projections must not become the hidden source of truth unless the contract explicitly says so;
- projection writes, if allowed, validate schema and then call the typed repository.

### 5.4 High-churn runtime state

Examples from current production:

```text
engine/.runtime/**
engine/projects/**
engine/orchestrator/failures.json
engine/README.md
```

Rules:

- must not be indexed as semantic memory;
- should use typed runtime repositories when queryable;
- if file-shaped blobs are needed, mount under `/engine/runtime` or `/engine` with `IndexPolicy::NotIndexed`;
- writes should not create memory chunks, embeddings, or memory versions unless explicitly converted into knowledge.

OpenAI-compatible ref mappings are high-churn runtime/control-plane state under
`/engine/openai_compat/refs`. Callers must go through `OpenAiCompatRefStore`;
generic filesystem reads or writes are storage mechanics, not an authority path.
The stored JSON state is schema-validated on load and save, including
public-id/surface consistency, so malformed persisted mappings fail closed before
lookup, replay, bind, cancel, stream-resume, or projection retrieval.

---

## 6. Secrets and encrypted raw storage

Secrets use a dedicated semantic boundary above raw persistence:

```text
SecretStore / Credential*Store
  -> authorizes and validates secret operations
  -> encrypts plaintext before persistence
  -> decrypts only after the caller has crossed the secret-store boundary

RawSecretRecordStore / EncryptedBlobStore / filesystem/object/SQL backend
  -> stores ciphertext and metadata only
  -> has no plaintext API and no secret-domain semantics
```

`ironclaw_filesystem` may be one implementation of raw encrypted blob storage.
It must not expose secret material through generic file listing, file reads,
errors, events, or projections. Secret APIs own listing semantics, redaction,
key rotation, expiry, use-counts, and audit obligations.

## 7. Filesystem catalog requirements

Every mounted filesystem backend should expose a `MountDescriptor` containing:

```text
virtual_root
backend_id
backend_kind
storage_class
content_kind
index_policy
capabilities
```

Here `capabilities` means backend support flags. It is not the same concept as extension capability declarations.

Catalog lookup answers placement only. It does not grant authority.

Untrusted/runtime access still requires:

```text
ScopedPath -> MountView -> permission check -> VirtualPath -> backend
```

---

## 8. Backend support policy

Backend capability fields are support declarations, not extension capability declarations and not authority grants.

The terminology is overloaded today because some types already use names such as `BackendCapabilities` and `MemoryBackendCapabilities`. In this storage contract, those fields mean:

```text
what this backend can safely perform after the host has already authorized scope and selected the backend
```

They do not mean:

```text
caller-visible extension action
approval/lease authority
permission to bypass ScopedFilesystem or MountView checks
```

Backend support declarations are enforcement inputs, not documentation only. Unsupported behavior fails before backend side effects.

Examples:

- if `delete = false`, delete fails before backend side effects;
- if `indexed = false`, callers must not assume search visibility;
- if `embedded = false`, vector search must fail closed or omit vector results;
- if a memory backend sets `file_documents = false`, `/memory` file operations fail closed before plugin invocation.

A future implementation cleanup may rename these backend fields/types to `*Support` for clarity, but the frozen contract already distinguishes support declarations from extension capabilities.

---

## 9. Engineer task implications

Before implementing a persistence task, engineers must identify:

1. virtual area/prefix;
2. source-of-truth repository/backend;
3. scope fields, including `AgentId` if relevant;
4. whether filesystem access is source-of-truth or projection;
5. indexing policy;
6. delete/versioning behavior;
7. PostgreSQL/libSQL parity requirement;
8. migration/backfill impact;
9. whether shared storage mechanics should be reused or extended.

If the answer is not in this document or the owning domain contract, the task is not ready for implementation.

---

## 10. Acceptance tests for placement changes

Any new storage placement must include:

- tenant/user/project/agent isolation test when scoped;
- source-of-truth test proving writes go to the intended repository/backend;
- projection test if file views are exposed;
- no-indexing test for control-plane/runtime state;
- redaction/no-host-path test for errors/events;
- PostgreSQL/libSQL parity test if the backend is production-persistent.
