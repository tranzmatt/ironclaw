# Reborn ProductAdapter contract

**Status:** Draft (first slice landing for #3285).
**Owner crate:** `ironclaw_product_adapters`.
**Host runtime:** `ironclaw_wasm_product_adapters`.
**First concrete adapter:** `ironclaw_telegram_v2_adapter`.
**Related issues:** #3269 (this contract), #3285 (Telegram tracer bullet),
#3266 (outbound policy), #3193 (conversation binding), #3094 (gate UX).

## Purpose

Define the boundary between channel/transport-specific code and the canonical
Reborn pipeline. Adapters parse external protocol payloads into structured
inbound envelopes and protocol-translate projection-derived outbound
envelopes back to the external surface. Adapters do NOT own canonical
thread/run/transcript state, do NOT call `TurnCoordinator` directly, and do
NOT expose raw protocol secrets to themselves or to WASM components.
Outbound policy selects and revalidates a sendable target before rendering.
`ProductAdapter::render_outbound` translates the authorized outbound envelope
for the product surface and may only use host-provided `ProtocolHttpEgress` for
network I/O. It does not choose the delivery target, own communication
resolution, or bypass outbound delivery-attempt recording.

## Layering

```text
protocol event (webhook / cookie / bearer / cli)
  -> host verifies protocol auth (mints ProtocolAuthEvidence::Verified)
  -> ProductAdapter::parse_inbound(raw_payload, evidence)
       -> ProductInboundEnvelope (or None for ambient/no-op events)
  -> ProductWorkflow::submit_inbound(envelope)
       -> ConversationBindingService -> SessionThreadService -> TurnCoordinator
  -> ProductInboundAck (Accepted / DeferredBusy / Rejected / Duplicate / NoOp)
  -> protocol layer maps ack to status code

projection read / fetch
  -> caller resolves any opaque product/API id into canonical Reborn metadata
  -> ProductWorkflow::read_projection(ProductProjectionReadInput)
       -> ProjectionReadRequest

projection stream / subscription
  -> ProductWorkflow::subscribe_projection(ProductProjectionSubscribeInput)
       -> ProjectionSubscriptionRequest
  -> ProjectionStream::drain(request)
       -> ProductOutboundEnvelope(s)

projection update
  -> ProductOutboundEnvelope (FinalReply / Progress / GatePrompt / ...)
  -> ProductAdapter::render_outbound(envelope, &dyn ProtocolHttpEgress)
       -> ProtocolHttpEgress (declared host + credential handle)
  -> OutboundDeliverySink::record(DeliveryStatus)
```

## Frozen invariants

- ProductAdapter DTOs carry only structured external refs:
  `ExternalActorRef`, `ExternalConversationRef`, `ExternalEventId`,
  `ProductAttachmentDescriptor`. No raw bytes, source URLs, host paths, raw
  prompts, raw tool input, or backend diagnostics.
- `ProtocolAuthEvidence::Verified` is sealed. Only the host-glue helpers in
  `ironclaw_product_adapters::auth` (which take a crate-private
  `HostAuthSeal`) can construct one. WASM components and downstream adapters
  cannot fabricate verification.
- Product adapters must not construct host-trusted trigger ingress markers or
  witnesses. Trigger and scheduler fires use the host-trusted ingress seam in
  `ironclaw_conversations`, not a public adapter payload or a reserved string
  in adapter-controlled DTOs. PR18 enforces this with dependency-boundary tests;
  trigger delivery must harden the seam with a compile-time host facade or
  equivalent sealed factory before launch.
- `ProtocolHttpEgress` is the only network capability. Adapters declare
  egress hosts up front (`DeclaredEgressHost`) and address credentials via
  opaque handles (`EgressCredentialHandle`). The host resolves credential
  material at request time and scans response bodies for leaks before
  returning them.
- Adapters MUST NOT depend on `ironclaw_dispatcher`, `ironclaw_capabilities`,
  `ironclaw_host_runtime`, `ironclaw_network`, `ironclaw_secrets`,
  `ironclaw_filesystem`, raw process spawning, or
  `ironclaw_turns::runner`. Boundary tests in
  `crates/ironclaw_product_adapters/tests/product_adapter_contract.rs`
  enforce this.
- Delivery failures are best-effort. They record a separate
  `DeliveryStatus` and never mutate canonical transcript/projection/turn
  state.

## Inbound

`ProductInboundEnvelope` fields:

- `adapter_id: ProductAdapterId`
- `installation_id: AdapterInstallationId`
- `external_event_id: ExternalEventId` — stable per-installation event id
  used for dedupe.
- `external_actor_ref: ExternalActorRef` — protocol's stable user id +
  optional display name.
- `external_conversation_ref: ExternalConversationRef` — protocol's
  conversation key (chat id + optional topic id) plus an optional
  reply-target message id (NOT part of the canonical key).
- `auth_evidence: ProtocolAuthEvidence`
- `received_at: DateTime<Utc>`
- `payload: ProductInboundPayload` — UserMessage / Command /
  ApprovalResolution / ScopedApprovalResolution / AuthResolution /
  ProjectionRead / SubscriptionRequest / ControlAction / LinkedThreadAction /
  NoOp.

`ProductWorkflow` has three effect-boundary doors:

- `submit_inbound(ProductInboundEnvelope)` for mutating submit/control actions:
  user messages, commands, approval/auth resolutions, linked-thread actions,
  typed control actions, and no-op acknowledgements. Projection reads and
  projection subscriptions must not be submitted through this mutating path.
- `read_projection(ProductProjectionReadInput)` for non-mutating projection
  reads/fetches. Callers may provide adapter external refs for workflow binding
  resolution or already-canonicalized actor/scope metadata after resolving an
  opaque product/API id outside ProductWorkflow.
- `subscribe_projection(ProductProjectionSubscribeInput)` for non-mutating
  projection subscriptions. Legacy `resolve_projection_subscription(...)` is a
  compatibility wrapper that converts the old envelope shape into typed
  subscribe input.

`accept_inbound(...)` remains a compatibility wrapper around `submit_inbound(...)`.
New host/adapter/API wiring should call the specific door that matches the
operation's effect boundary.

`ProductInboundEnvelope` does not model host-internal trigger or scheduler
ingress. Synthetic trusted trigger ingress is handled by the conversation-owned
trusted trigger submitter returned to host composition as a
`TrustedTriggerFireSubmitter` trait object; the raw `TrustedInboundTurnRequest`
constructor, concrete submitter type, and trusted scope mapping stay private
inside `ironclaw_conversations` and are not constructible by product adapters.

`ProductInboundAck` outcomes:

- `Accepted { accepted_message_ref, submitted_run_id }`
- `DeferredBusy { accepted_message_ref, active_run_id }`
- `Rejected(ProductRejection { kind, reason })`
- `Duplicate { prior: Box<ProductInboundAck> }`
- `NoOp`

Webhook ack semantics:

| Outcome | Protocol response |
|--------|-------------------|
| `Accepted` / `DeferredBusy` / `Duplicate` / `NoOp` | 200 OK |
| `Rejected { BindingRequired \| AccessDenied \| UnknownInstallation }` | 403 |
| `Rejected { PolicyDenied }` | 403/422 (protocol-specific) |
| `Authentication` failure (host-side) | 401/403 |
| `WorkflowTransient` failure | 5xx/429 (retryable) |

## Outbound

Outbound delivery enters here only after outbound policy has already selected a
candidate `ReplyTargetBindingRef` and revalidated it for the current scope.
`ProductAdapter::render_outbound` turns that validated envelope into a protocol
payload; it does not decide which target should receive the message.

`ProductOutboundEnvelope` fields:

- `adapter_id`, `installation_id`
- `target: ReplyTargetBindingRef`
- `projection_cursor: Option<ProjectionCursor>`
- `payload: ProductOutboundPayload` — FinalReply / Progress /
  CapabilityActivity / GatePrompt / AuthPrompt / ProjectionSnapshot /
  ProjectionUpdate
- `delivery_attempt_id: Uuid`

Capabilities (`ProductAdapterCapabilities`):

- `InboundMessages`, `InboundCommands`, `InboundAttachments`
- `ExternalFinalReplyPush`, `ExternalProgressPush` (opt-in per #3266),
  `ExternalGatePush` (deferred to #3094)
- `ProjectionSubscription`, `SynchronousWait`, `DeliveryStatusReporting`

`ProductAdapterCapabilities::external_channel_default()` is the safe
preset for chat channels: inbound messages/commands/attachments + final
reply push + delivery status reporting, without progress or gate push.

## Authentication evidence

Verifiers in `ironclaw_wasm_product_adapters::auth_verifier` provide
constant-time HMAC and shared-secret-header verification. The host calls a
verifier first and only constructs a `Verified` evidence (via one of the
public `mark_*_verified` helpers) when the digest matches.

Adapters never read the secret. Verifiers run with `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`
to avoid timing oracles.

## Egress

`ProtocolHttpEgress` requests carry:

- `host: DeclaredEgressHost`
- `method`, `path`, `headers`, `body`
- `credential_handle: Option<EgressCredentialHandle>`

Component runtime uses v1-style minimal WASI p2 for wasm32-wasip2 guest compatibility:
clock/random are available, but env, args, stdio, preopened directories, and
network are not inherited. The first WASM runtime slice is parse/render-only:
`render-outbound` returns a host-validated typed `EgressRequest`, while the
component `http-egress` import fails closed until follow-up host-runtime wiring
injects the production `ProtocolHttpEgress` path. Native adapters already use
`ProtocolHttpEgress` directly.

The production host egress path:

1. Validates the host against the adapter manifest's declared list.
2. Validates the credential handle against the per-installation
   allowlist (`EgressPolicy`).
3. Resolves the handle to an actual secret at request time (out-of-band).
4. Sends the request.
5. Scans the response for leaks before returning.
6. Reports `DeliveryStatus` to the registered `OutboundDeliverySink`.

## Default-off + cutover

Telegram v2 (and any other future v2 product adapter) is enabled by an
explicit feature flag (`REBORN_TELEGRAM_V2_ENABLED=true` for Telegram).
Default is off; legacy v1 Telegram (`channels-src/telegram`) runs
unchanged. The host fails closed at startup when v1 and v2 are both
configured for the same installation; see
`ironclaw::config::validate_telegram_v1_v2_exclusivity`.
