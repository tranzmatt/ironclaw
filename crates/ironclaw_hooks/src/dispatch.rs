//! Hook dispatcher — invokes the active hooks for a point with deterministic
//! ordering, panic isolation, timeout enforcement, slot poisoning on protocol
//! violation, and short-circuit semantics for gate phases.
//!
//! This crate ships the dispatcher contract; the Reborn-side middleware that
//! wires it into `LoopCapabilityPort` / `LoopPromptPort` / etc. lives in
//! `ironclaw_reborn::loop_driver_host` and lands in a follow-up slice.

/// → optional milestone sink → installed hooks. After construction it is
/// almost always wrapped in [`Arc`] and handed to a host factory, at which
/// point further mutation is impossible. The builder makes that lifecycle
/// the *only* public construction path: callers chain configuration calls
/// and terminate with [`HookDispatcherBuilder::build_arc`], which performs
/// the `Arc` wrap and returns an immutable handle.
