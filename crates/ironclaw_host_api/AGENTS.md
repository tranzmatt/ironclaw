# Agent Map — ironclaw_host_api

## Start Here

- Read `CLAUDE.md` first; it is the crate-local guardrail file.
- Read `Cargo.toml` for actual dependencies and feature shape.
- Use these Reborn contracts as the source of truth before changing behavior:
- `docs/reborn/contracts/host-api.md`
- `docs/reborn/contracts/kernel-boundary.md`
- `docs/reborn/contracts/capability-access.md`

## What This Crate Owns

- Shared authority vocabulary and neutral host contracts: IDs, scopes, paths, actions, decisions, resources, approvals, audit, HTTP, dispatch, runtime-policy, and trust types.
- Crate-local public API, tests, and fixtures needed to prove that ownership.

## Do Not Move In Here

- runtime execution, persistence, HTTP clients, product workflow, policy engines, and dependencies on other service/runtime crates.
- Secrets, raw host paths, backend error details, and unredacted user content in errors, events, snapshots, logs, or docs.

## Validation

- Fast local check: `cargo test -p ironclaw_host_api`
- Boundary check after dependency/API changes: `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture`
- If production persistence behavior changes, add/maintain PostgreSQL and libSQL parity tests.

## Agent Notes

- `HostPortGrant` is intentionally a thin scoped-view grant token over `HostPortId`. Do not add attenuation/scope/expiry fields to that wire shape; introduce a distinct scoped/attenuated grant type if that behavior lands later.
- Keep edits inside this crate unless a contract explicitly requires a neighboring crate change.
- Prefer caller-level tests when a helper gates dispatch, persistence, network, secrets, approvals, resources, events, or process side effects.
- If the contract and code disagree, stop and treat the task as a contract-change request instead of silently changing ownership.
