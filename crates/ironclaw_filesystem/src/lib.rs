//! Scoped filesystem service for IronClaw Reborn.
//!
//! `ironclaw_filesystem` is the first service crate above
//! `ironclaw_host_api`. It resolves runtime-visible [`ScopedPath`] values
//! through a caller's [`MountView`], checks mount permissions, then performs the
//! operation against a trusted root filesystem namespace addressed by
//! [`VirtualPath`]. Backend implementations alone touch raw host paths.
//!
//! The local backend canonicalizes existing paths and their nearest existing
//! ancestors before opening files, and it re-roots new leaf paths on the checked
//! canonical parent. That narrows symlink escape opportunities but does not
//! provide a kernel-enforced race-free guarantee against a writable mount root
//! being modified between containment checks and opens. Production hardening for
//! hostile local directories should use fd-relative traversal such as `openat2`
//! with `RESOLVE_BENEATH`, `O_NOFOLLOW`, or a capability filesystem crate.
