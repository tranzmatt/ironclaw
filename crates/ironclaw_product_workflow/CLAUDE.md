# ironclaw_product_workflow

Product-facing workflow facade for IronClaw Reborn (issue #3280).

## Purpose

Sits between product adapters and host-layer Reborn services. Owns the product
action orchestration so adapters (Web, API, CLI, Telegram, etc.) do not each
reimplement binding resolution, message staging, idempotency, busy/deferred
handling, gate routing, mission routing, and redacted acknowledgements.

## Key types

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| `DefaultProductWorkflow` | Top-level orchestrator implementing `ProductWorkflow` trait |
| `InboundTurnService` / `DefaultInboundTurnService` | User-message turn submission path |
| `ConversationBindingService` | Resolves external adapter refs → canonical Reborn identifiers |
| `IdempotencyLedger` | Durable action deduplication port |
| `ProductInboundAction` | Durable ledger record for inbound actions |
| `RebornServicesApi` / `RebornServices` | Native WebChat v2 facade — stable surface beta WebUI route handlers consume in place of reaching into turn coordination, thread stores, runtime lanes, dispatchers, or capability hosts. Enforces caller ownership of the thread before any turn mutation; rejects stale or attacker-supplied `gate_ref` on denied/cancelled gate resolutions; refuses persistent (`always: true`) approvals until an approval-policy port lands |

## Dependencies

- `ironclaw_product_adapters` — trait definitions, envelope/ack types, `ProjectionStream` for SSE
- `ironclaw_turns` — turn coordinator, scope, IDs
- `ironclaw_threads` — session thread service contract
- `ironclaw_host_api` — canonical identifiers (TenantId, UserId, etc.)

## Boundary rules

Must NOT depend on: `ironclaw_dispatcher`, `ironclaw_extensions`,
`ironclaw_host_runtime`, `ironclaw_mcp`, `ironclaw_wasm`, `ironclaw_scripts`,
`ironclaw_network`, `ironclaw_engine`, `ironclaw_gateway`.

## Test support

Enable `test-support` feature for in-memory fakes:
- `FakeConversationBindingService`
- `FakeIdempotencyLedger`
- `FakeInboundTurnService`
